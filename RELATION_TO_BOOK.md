# Relation to the Book

This repository is structurally derived from the book:

**MACHWERK – Formal Conditions of Physical Describability**  
Print-on-demand publication, Amazon  
Release date: February 1, 2026  
ISBN assigned

The book contains the full conceptual development, motivation,
methodological discussion, and applied analyses.

This repository contains **only the extracted formal core**:

- axioms,
- definitions,
- admissibility conditions,
- structural boundary concepts.

All applications, model analyses, and physical case studies
remain exclusively in the book.

This separation is intentional.

The book explains *why* the framework exists.  
This repository specifies *how* it is formally structured.
