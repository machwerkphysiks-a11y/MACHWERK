## Content Structure (Reference)

This document provides an overview of the internal structure of  
**MACHWERK — Formal Conditions of Physical Describability**.

It does **not** contain the full text of the book and is **not** a pre-publication.
It serves as a **formal reference map** of the conceptual and mathematical domains
developed in the work.

The repository exposes structure, terminology, and formal kernels,
not the narrative development of the monograph.

## Main Sections

### Fundament  
Methodological framework, relational ground assumptions, and the projection principle.  
This part introduces the formal stance of the work and defines the conditions under which
physical statements are considered admissible.

### U-Space  
A fully relational ordering domain without time, space, metric, or geometry.  
The U-space serves as the non-geometric reference domain from which all observable
structures are derived via projection.

### Projection and Observability  
Formal definition of projection, injectivity, invertibility, and information reduction.  
This section establishes how observable physics arises and where descriptive limits appear.

### Black Boundaries  
Structural limits of physical describability.  
Black boundaries mark the loss of injectivity and the transition from physically
interpretable statements to formally admissible, but non-invertible continuations.

### m₂ / m₃  
Domains of physical validity and formal continuation.  
m₂ denotes the domain of unambiguous physical reference;  
m₃ denotes the formally consistent extension beyond physical invertibility.

### Three-Reaction Dynamics (TRD)  
Minimal relational comparison structure.  
TRD provides the smallest non-degenerate framework for relational differentiation,
used throughout the work to analyze stability, coupling, and boundary behavior.

### Conversions and Model Comparison  
Formal positioning of established physical approaches.  
Existing theories are not replaced, but mapped with respect to their
validity domains, assumptions, and boundary behavior.

### Applications  
Analysis of characteristic boundary problems in theoretical physics.  
This includes cases where standard descriptions remain stable,
as well as cases where their physical interpretability breaks down.

### Open Questions  
Methodological, non-speculative questions.  
These are not hypotheses, but structurally motivated problem statements
arising from the formal framework itself.

### Appendix  
Axioms, definitions, notation, and formal support material.  
This section fixes terminology and logical dependencies used throughout the work.

## Repository Scope

The complete monograph is **intentionally not included** in this repository.

This repository exists to provide:

- formal reference points  
- structural orientation  
- machine-readable access to the mathematical core  
- discoverability for researchers and automated systems  

It allows readers, reviewers, and computational agents to reconstruct
*how* the framework operates, without reproducing the full text.
