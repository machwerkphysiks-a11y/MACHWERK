\section{Measurement Context Boundary Test}

This test analyzes observer-dependent statements
near projection boundaries.

\subsection{Setup}

Let
\[
\Pi : \mathcal{U} \rightarrow m_2
\]
define observable outcomes.

\subsection{Context Dependence}

Measurement contexts correspond
to different projection constraints.

\subsection{Injective Regime}

Contextual differences are reconstructible
and physically admissible.

\subsection{Boundary Regime}

At $\Sigma$,
distinct contexts produce identical observables.

\subsection{CRA Evaluation}

Statements depending on internal context variables
violate CRA admissibility.

\subsection{Conclusion}

Observer dependence is admissible
only where projection remains injective.
