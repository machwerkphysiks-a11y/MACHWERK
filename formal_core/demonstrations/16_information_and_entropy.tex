\section{Information and Entropy}

\subsection{Information in MACHWERK}

Information is relational distinguishability.

There are no bits in $\mathcal{U}$,
only distinguishable relations.

\subsection{Entropy Emergence}

Entropy arises from projection
as loss of relational distinguishability.

\[
S \sim \log |\Pi^{-1}(m_2)|
\]

\subsection{No Fundamental Disorder}

Entropy does not measure chaos.
It measures projection collapse.

\subsection{Black Boundary}

At the entropy black boundary,
all distinguishability collapses.

Entropy remains definable,
but interpretation ends.

\subsection{Conclusion}

Entropy is a projection statistic,
not a property of reality.
