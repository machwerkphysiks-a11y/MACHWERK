\section{Physical Constants as Projection Artifacts}

\subsection{Problem Class}

Physical constants are treated
as universal parameters.

MACHWERK treats them
as projection stabilizers.

\subsection{Origin}

Constants arise from:

\begin{itemize}
\item projection scale fixing
\item relational normalization
\item domain stabilization
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Non-Fundamentality}

Constants do not exist in $\mathcal{U}$.
They exist only within $m_2$.

\subsection{Black Boundary}

At projection breakdown,
constants lose meaning
without becoming undefined.

\subsection{Conclusion}

Constants are not discovered.
They are projection-specific invariants.
