\section{Momentum}

Momentum is a relational quantity.

It arises from the comparison of process rate changes
across a reference structure.

\subsection{Formal Character}

Momentum exists only where directional relational ordering
is well-defined under projection.

\subsection{Admissibility}

Momentum statements require:
\begin{itemize}
\item stable relational direction
\item injective projection
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Boundary Behavior}

At Schwarzgrenzen, directional distinction collapses.
Momentum becomes physically inadmissible.
