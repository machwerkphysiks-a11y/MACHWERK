\section{Energy}

Energy is not a stored substance.

Energy is a
\textbf{relational invariance measure}
under admissible transformations.

\subsection{Formal Meaning}

Energy characterizes stability properties
of relational change under projection.

It has no independent existence in $\mathcal{U}$.

\subsection{Admissibility}

Energy statements are admissible only within $m_2$,
where relational configurations remain uniquely projectable.

\subsection{Conservation}

Energy conservation is not an ontological law.

It is a statement about:
\begin{itemize}
\item projection stability
\item relational symmetry
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Boundary Behavior}

Beyond injective domains,
energy may be formally continued
but loses physical meaning.
