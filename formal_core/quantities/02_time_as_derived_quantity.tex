\section{Time as a Derived Quantity}

Time is not fundamental.

Time arises as a comparison
between repeating relational processes.

Let
\[
T = \frac{R_a}{R_b}
\]

Time measurement corresponds to
the stabilization of this ratio
under projection.

Time has no meaning in $\mathcal{U}$.
It exists only in projected spaces.
