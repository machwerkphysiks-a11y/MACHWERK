\section{Injectivity}

A projection
\[
\Pi : \mathcal{U} \rightarrow \mathcal{M}
\]
is injective on a subset $\mathcal{U}_0 \subset \mathcal{U}$ if and only if
\[
\forall u_1, u_2 \in \mathcal{U}_0:
\quad
\Pi(u_1) = \Pi(u_2) \Rightarrow u_1 = u_2 .
\]

Injectivity guarantees that observable distinctions correspond
to distinct relational configurations.

Loss of injectivity implies that multiple relational states
collapse onto the same observable representation.

Injectivity is a local property.
It may hold in one region of $\mathcal{U}$ and fail in another.
