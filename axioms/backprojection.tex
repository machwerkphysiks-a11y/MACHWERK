\section{Backprojection}

A backprojection
\[
\Pi^{-1} : m \rightarrow \mathcal{U}
\]
is defined on a subset $m_2 \subseteq m$ if and only if
the projection $\Pi$ is injective on the corresponding domain.

Formally,
\[
\exists\, \Pi^{-1}
\;\Longleftrightarrow\;
\Pi \text{ is injective on } m_2.
\]

Backprojection is not assumed globally.
It is a conditional construct tied to projection stability.

Outside of $m_2$, symbols may remain formally manipulable,
but no unique relational origin exists.
